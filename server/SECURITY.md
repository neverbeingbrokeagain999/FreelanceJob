# Security Considerations

## Immediate Actions Required

1. MongoDB Credentials
   - [ ] Rotate the MongoDB Atlas credentials that were exposed
   - [ ] Update the .env file with new credentials
   - [ ] Consider using environment-specific connection strings

2. Secret Keys
   - [ ] Generate new JWT secret
   - [ ] Update session secret
   - [ ] Consider using a secure secret generation service

## Security Features Implemented

1. Environment Variables
   - Sensitive configuration stored in .env files
   - Template provided in .env.template
   - Environment files ignored by git

2. Logging Security
   - Sensitive data masking for logs
   - MongoDB connection strings masked
   - Passwords and tokens automatically hidden
   - Structured logging format

3. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
   - Secure cookie handling

4. Data Security
   - Input validation
   - XSS protection via Helmet
   - CORS configuration
   - Request size limits

## Best Practices

1. Never commit .env files to version control
2. Use strong, unique passwords for each environment
3. Regularly rotate credentials and secrets
4. Monitor application logs for security events
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Use environment-specific security settings
